            Founded on 24 June 1910 in Milan, Italy as A.L.F.A.—an acronym for Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili[a]—the company was established by Cavaliere Ugo Stella to acquire the assets of the ailing Italian subsidiary of French carmaker Darracq, of which he had been an investor and manager.</p>

          <p>It’s hard to think of any electric vehicle, let alone one costing less than £40,000, generating greater anticipation than the Alpine A290. With good reason, too: the A110 sports car is brilliant, Renault has more experience in small electric vehicles than most, the engineers involved are saying all the right things about driver focus and the prototype tests have all returned favourable reviews (as per every verdict after an ice drive, in fairness). But it’s a small, light(ish) hot hatch from the country and the people that have made the very best small, light hot hatches over the years - so there's good cause for all the excitement. </p>

                The original S6 was largely identical to the outgoing Audi S4 (C4) (Often referred to as the Ur-S4), with the only visible differences being new body-cladding and badging. In certain markets where the even-higher performance RS6 (which is also based on the A6) is not sold, the S6 serves as the most powerful trim level for the A6 lineup.</p>

Leonard Lord represented BMC and Donald Healey his firm.

                BMC merged with Jaguar Cars in 1966 to form British Motor Holdings (BMH). Donald Healey left BMH in 1968 when it merged into British Leyland. Healey then joined Jensen Motors, which had been making bodies for the "big Healeys" since their inception in 1952, and became their chairman in 1972. Austin-Healey cars were produced until 1972 when the 20-year agreement between Healey and Austin came to an end.</p>

                The Flying Spur is assembled by hand at Bentley's factory in Crewe, England.

This arrangement ended in early 2007, when all assembly works reverted to Crewe.</p>

            <p>The roots of Mulliner can be traced back to a family of carriers and saddlers in 1559, just one year after Elizabeth I came to the throne. The Mulliner name did not come to prominence until 1760, however, when F. Mulliner was commissioned to build and maintain carriages for the Royal Mail. In 1870, Robert Bouverie Mulliner started his own coachbuilding company called Mulliner London Limited, following in his forbears’ continuous pursuit of perfection.

                At the turn of the 19th century, H.J. Mulliner moved the family business to London’s fashionable Mayfair, under the name H.J. Mulliner & Co. From there, the company was perfectly placed to serve society’s elite. From this foundation, H.J. Mulliner & Co would exquisitely handcraft each coach around their client’s exacting requirements.</p>

M3 saloons were offered initially during the E36 (1994–1999) and E90 (2008–2012) generations. Since 2014, the coupé and convertible models have been rebranded as the 4 Series range, making the high-performance variant the M4.

                The first M5 model was hand-built beginning in late 1984 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production saloon at the time.[6] M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1984, with occasional gaps in production (1995 to 1998, 2023 to 2024).</p>

In keeping with the Bugatti brand lineage, however, it does share many of its key design cues, including the horseshoe grille, central spine, C-shaped side body lines, and two-tone body colour. One of the stated inspirations for the Tourbillon was mechanical watches, with the car containing a fully analog center console operated by mechanical gears designed to look like a watch movement, while the speedometer and tachometer needles were arranged to resemble an hour and minute hand.[8] Another design theme of the Tourbillon is a "skeletonized" mechanical design, where the mechanisms of components are made visible as a part of the design</p>

Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim "a car for every purse and purpose", picked the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International</p>

The DeLorean is sometimes referred to by its internal DMC pre-production designation, DMC-12.[10][11][12] However, the DMC-12 name was never used in sales or marketing materials for the production model.[13]

                Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, the DeLorean is noted for its gull-wing doors and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as its lack of power and performance incongruous with its looks and price.

            <p>The company manufactures and distributes the Ultima Evolution car. The current Evolution is available in two body designs: coupé and convertible. The Ultima Evolution coupé and Ultima Evolution convertible have body styles unchanged from the preceding Ultima GTR and Ultima Can-Am models respectively. Before the GTR and Can-Am models, the two models produced were the Ultima Sport and Ultima Spyder.

                The Ultima Sport and its roadster derivative, the Ultima Spyder, were built from 1992 to 1999. The body styles were carried over largely unchanged for the succeeding Ultima GTR and Ultima Can-Am (roadster) models. The first Ultima produced was the Ultima Mk1 produced in 1983 by Lee Noble of Noble Motorsports Ltd. The car was intended to go into production, but only one was produced because before any were sold, the Ultima Mk2 was introduced in 1989. The Mk2 is based on the Mk1 but features new suspension and better brakes. The car won many races and championships in smaller series, being driven by Noble and Ted Marlow.[1] It was featured on the covers of Kitcars and Specials magazine, Sports Car Monthly Magazine, and Autochromes Magazine.</p>

            <p>The Vauxhall VXR8 is a performance car marketed by Vauxhall in the United Kingdom between 2007 and 2017, based on two different models produced by Holden Special Vehicles: the HSV Clubsport (2007–2009) and HSV GTS (2010–2017). The VXR8 is the successor to both the Vauxhall Monaro VXR and the Vauxhall Omega/Carlton. Initially powered by a 411 bhp (306 kW) Gen IV LS2 6.0 litre V8, from late 2009 it was upgraded to the Gen IV LS3 6.2 litre V8 with 425 bhp (317 kW), shared with the Chevrolet Corvette C6 and the Chevrolet Camaro SS. The Vauxhall initially mainly competed with other large sport sedans such as the Audi RS6, BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E55/E63 AMG, and although it was somewhat bigger in almost all dimensions than them, was not enough to touch luxury territory.</p>

            <p>Wiesmann GmbH is a German automobile manufacturer that specializes in hand-built custom convertibles and coupes. Brothers Martin Wiesmann and Friedhelm Wiesmann founded the company in 1988 which has its headquarters located in Dülmen.[1] The business was temporarily closed in May 2014,[2] and following a buyout by London-based investor Roheen Berry who took over as CEO,[3][4] it is set to return with a new model, powered by a BMW M division-sourced V8 engine.[5][6][7] The relaunch of the Wiesmann brand has more than one model, including an electric vehicle, in the pipeline and the pre-development phase of the car has been completed. A teaser video of the brand's rebirth, posted on their website, tells viewers to “expect the unexpected”.[8]

                In its previous era, Wiesmann used BMW's six-cylinder engines to power its MF models until the introduction in 2003 of the GT MF4, which used BMW's 4.8-litre V8, and the MF5, which used the M5's 5.0-litre V10</p>

                The Dawn was built on the platform of the Rolls-Royce Ghost, unlike the earlier model which was based on the 7th Generation Rolls-Royce Phantom, the flagship car model of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars until the arrival of the 8th Generation and the Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupé.
                
                The Rolls-Royce Dawn is the last open top combustion car made by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. Wraith and Dawn are the only remaining Rolls-Royce vehicles using a BMW platform, so their demise was quite expected. It's confirmed that the Spectre replaces the Rolls-Royce Wraith Coupé and the Dawn Cabriolet.</p>
